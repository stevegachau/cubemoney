# CubeSmasher
Cubesmasher is a gamified token mining app built on the Matic Network. Players accumulate mining stakes by smashing cubes. Every hour 1000 CUBE Tokens are distributed to all miners in proportion to their mining stakes. Mining stakes are reset every hour.

Mining stake calculation: 100 cubes smashed = 1 mining stake.
